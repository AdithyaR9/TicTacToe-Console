# TicTacToe-Console

Created February 2019
Uploded July 30 2021

This is a tic tac toe game that plays inside the console. It takes in each player's row and column for their desired move, and then displays the board in the console using the characters '-' and '|' in a specific way with 'X' and 'O' to represent the players. 

I created this when I first learned about arrays and 2D arrays and how they could be used to make grid-based games, like Chess and Checkers.
